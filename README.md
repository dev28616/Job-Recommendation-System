# **Job Recommendation System** 🚀  

This project presents a **Job Recommendation System** that uses advanced machine learning techniques to recommend relevant job listings based on user preferences. It leverages classification algorithms for accurate and efficient recommendations.

---

## **Features** ✨  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts textual data into meaningful numerical representations.  
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures relevance between job descriptions and user preferences.  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Implements similarity-based matching.  
- **Logistic Regression**: Enhances predictive capabilities for better job recommendations.
